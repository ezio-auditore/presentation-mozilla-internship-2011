Slide 1
-------
* My name is John Karahalis. I am a Computer Science student here at the 
  Rochester Institute of Technology.
* I wanted to thank Remy for inviting me here to talk about my co-op at 
  Mozilla.
* The title of my talk is "MDN Development Process Improvements". The MDN, for 
  those who don't know, is the Mozilla Developer Network, Mozilla's 
  documentation and education website.

Slide 2
-------
* So what did I do this summer? This is how I capture it in one sentence. 
  "Found problems, offered solutions, and got people excited along the way."
* That picture on the left is a "Norman door" and you can look at that door for
  just a few seconds and realize why it needs to be fixed. That's the kind of 
  stuff I love doing. By the way, there's a door just like this [point] over 
  there. Anyone who has ever come through here has probably run into it before.  
  And I mean that literally. RUN INTO it.
* My work this summer involved three areas: engagement, user research, and
  software engineering

Slide 3
-------
* Engagement.
* My biggest engagement project this summer was my work to promote the June Dev 
  Derby, a contest that encourages creative web developers to compete for 
  prizes while sharing their work with the world.
* I searched for developers doing interesting work, learned as much as I could 
  about them, and "started the conversation".

Slide 4
-------
* The results?
* 11% of the people I contacted ended up contributing
* 21% of all June contributors came from this group
* 34% of all June demos came from this group
* We got some really great submissions, including some have already become 
  famous at Mozilla.

Slide 5
-------
* User research.
* I interviewed some core MDN users and outlined all takeaways in bugs so that 
  developers could start working on them. More on that later.
* Some highlights...
    * One user said in passing "When users start liking articles, we'll do 
      XYZ". This was interesting because we had never considered users liking 
      articles. But we should have.
    * Another explained that it might be hard for him to learn the MDN, as he 
      had never used it to write a spec before. Again, we had no idea that he 
      was planning to use the site in this way.
    * Another user mentioned that user profiles on the site should list IRC 
      handles, as Mozilla uses IRC heavily. We had planned user profiles very 
      carefully, but this never crossed our minds.
    * My favorite was a user who mentioned that he was burned ever since the 
      site went offline for an extended period of time a couple of years ago.  
      It didn't, but it was an important point nonetheless. The site did 
      something to make this user believe it was broken, and we should fix 
      that.

Slide 6
-------
* And finally, my main focus this summer. I was hired by Mozilla especially 
  because I had experience with Scrum, a software engineering framework.
* This team had never used Scrum before, so I started slow.
    * I created a product backlog, a big, definitive list of features and met 
      with the team every three weeks to create a Sprint backlog, a list of 
      product backlog items to complete over a three week period.
* Most importantly, I started retrospective discussion -- a chance for the team 
  to identify what aspects of our process were working well and what aspects 
  weren't. As far as I am concerned, these discussions are the cornerstones of 
  Scrum.
* In these last few slides, I will outline some of the improvements that I made 
  in response to these discussions. Bear with me -- there are many examples 
  here, but I think it gives a great overview of the process improvements that 
  were made.

Slide 7
-------
* This one is sort of meta. A team member mentioned that "We should start an 
  email thread for discussing changes to our meetings and processes."
    * "We should start holding retrospective discussions."

Slide 8
-------
* I started an email thread to do exactly that. After doing this for a while, I 
  got some additional feedback from the team. "I'm glad we're actually making 
  the process better."

Slide 9
-------
* Here's another. "I would like if we had a Daily Standup."
    * For those unfamiliar with the term, a Daily Standup is just a short 
      meeting for a team to touch base once a day and identify problems that 
      are holding it back.

Slide 10
--------
* Again, I started doing exactly that.
* A couple of weeks later, I got more feedback from the team. "Daily standups 
  are great! They're short, unobtrusive, and I get a daily sync of what 
  everyone is doing."
    * These are all actual quotes, by the way.

Slide 11
--------
* Another. "I lose track of what I actually need to do for a release."

Slide 12
--------
* The solution? Provide a public link to each Sprint backlog, broken down by 
  team member.

Slide 13
--------
* "Our releases keep slipping."
    * If work was not done by the original deadline, the deadline was just 
      pushed back.

Slide 14
--------
* To solve this, I helped to enforce more strict "timeboxes". If work wasn't 
  completed by the deadline, it was moved out to later.
* This is an important point. The features moved, not the release dates.  
  Because we decided on a high-level goal for each period of work (which you can see 
  here), we had some flexibility to do this.
* Anyway, the result? "We finished with enough time for dedicated QA!"

Slide 15
--------
* "As a user, it's hard for me to know what you're working on."

Slide 16
--------
* I considered this a critical problem, so I responded with a very detailed 
  and well-thought-out process for providing feedback.
* The result? "This new feedback process sounds fabulous."

Slide 17
--------
* And finally, "We are very bad at estimating, so we never know how much work 
  we should take on at a time."

Slide 18
--------
* I worked with the team to start estimating individual tasks and, using some 
  spreadsheet magic, used this information to estimate the amount of work we 
  could complete in a given amount of time.
* "I like the point system - I think it gives us an idea how much we're doing, 
  where we're spending our effort, and if we're on track." 

Slide 19
--------
* So that was my summer. Finding problems, offering solutions, and getting 
  people excited along the way.
* My contact information is provided and if you're interested, a longer, 
  "director's cut" version of this presentation is available on GitHub.
* Otherwise, thanks!

Slide 20
--------
* Any questions?
