Slide 1
-------
* My name is John Karahalis. I am a Computer Science student here at the 
  Rochester Institute of Technology focusing on software engineering, psychology, and
  human-computer interaction.
    * I want the world to have more usable software, and try to help by 
      creating or managing that software.
* I'm here to talk to you about my internship at Mozilla.

Slide 2
-------
* So what did I do this summer? This is how I capture it in one sentence. 
  "Found problems, offered solutions, and got people excited along the way."
* That picture on the left is a reference to a "Norman door", and you can look 
  at that door for a few seconds and realize why it needs to be fixed. That's 
  the kind of stuff I love doing. By the way, there's a door just like this 
  [point] over there. Anyone who has ever come through here has probably run 
  into it before. Let me repeat that. Anyone who has ever come through here has 
  probably RUN INTO it before.
*  My work this summer really involved three areas: engagement, user research, 
   and software engineering

Slide 3
-------
* Engagement.
* My biggest engagement project this summer was my work to promote the June Dev 
  Derby, a contest that encouraged creative web developers to share their work 
  with the world.
* I searched for developers doing interesting work, learned as much as I could 
  about them, and "started the conversation".

Slide 4
-------
* The results?
* 11% of the people I contacted ended up contributing
* 21% of all June contributors came from this group
* 34% of all June demos came from this group
* We got some really great submissions, including some have already become 
  famous here at Mozilla.

Slide 5
-------
* User research.
* I did user research for the Mozilla Developer Network, Mozilla's 
  documentation and education website.
* I interviewed some core MDN users and outlined all takeaways in bugs so that 
  developers could start working on them. More on that later.
* Some highlights...
    * One user said "When users start liking articles, we'll do XYZ". This was 
      interesting because we had never considered users liking articles. But we 
      should have.
    * Another explained that it might be hard for him to learn the MDN, as he 
      had never used it to write a spec before. Again, we had no idea that he 
      was planning to use the site in this way.
    * Another user mentioned that user profiles on the site should list IRC 
      handles, as Mozilla uses IRC heavily. We had planned user profiles very 
      carefully, but this never crossed our minds.
    * My favorite was a user who mentioned that he was burned ever since the 
      site went offline for an extended period of time a couple of years ago.  
      It didn't, but it was an important point nonetheless. The site did 
      something to make this user believe it was broken, and we should fix that 
      in the future.

Slide 6
-------
* Software engineering.
* When I first joined, there were many feature discussions for the next version 
  of the MDN all over the place: EtherPad, the Mozilla Wiki, Google Docs, and 
  more.
* I've seen this problem many times in past work. Without a definitive record 
  of features, people don't remember what they decided on, duplicate work, and 
  forget what they promised to users and stakeholders.
* I made it my priority to change this. By the end of my first week, I 
  collected all of these discussions into one, comprehensive feature list.  
  There were no longer any questions. "If we talked about it, it's on the 
  list."

Slide 7
-------
* At about the same time, the team was discussing new ideas. "The interface 
  will look like this, the software will do that, etc." The problem was that 
  these discussions were informal but very detailed.
* Developers can't implement discussions, they need small, manageable chunks of 
  work.
* But they're busy enough already. The responsibility of distilling actionable 
  work from these discussions shouldn't be on their shoulders, it sould be on 
  my shoulders.
* To help the developers, I acted as the interface between discussions and 
  actionable work. "There's a lot of stuff being discussed over there, but 
  don't worry about that. I'll worry about that. You just worry about 
  completing work that is assigned to you in Bugzilla."

Slide 8
-------
* And finally, my main focus this summer. I was hired for this internship 
  especially because I had experience with Scrum, a software engineering 
  framework.
* This team had never used Scrum before, so I started slow.
    * I created a product backlog, that big, definitive list of features I 
      talked about earlier.
    * Every three weeks I would meet with the development team to look at that 
      product backlog, identify the high-priority work, and turn it into a 
      Sprint backlog, a list of things that should be done within a three-week 
      period.
* But most importantly, I started retrospective discussion -- a chance for the 
  team to identify what aspects of our process were working well and what 
  aspects weren't. As far as I am concerned, these discussions are the 
  cornerstones of Scrum.
* In these last few slides, I will outline some of the improvements that I 
  implemented in response to these discussions. Bear with me -- there are many 
  examples here (and this list doesn't even include everything!), but I think 
  it gives a good overview of the process improvements that were made.

Slide 9
-------
* This one is sort of meta. A team member mentioned that "We should start an 
  email thread for discussing changes to our meetings and processes."
    * "We should start holding retrospective discussions."

Slide 10
--------
* I started an email thread to do exactly that. After doing this for a while, I 
  got some additional feedback from the team. "I'm glad we're actually making 
  the process better."

Slide 11
--------
* Here's another. "I would like if we had a Daily Standup."
    * For those unfamiliar with the term, a Daily Standup is just a short 
      meeting for a team to touch base once a day and identify problems that 
      are holding it back.

Slide 12
--------
* Again, I started doing exactly that.
* A couple of weeks later, I got more feedback from the team. "Daily standups 
  are great! They're short, unobtrusive, and I get a daily sync of what 
  everyone is doing."
    * These are all actual quotes, by the way.

Slide 13
--------
* Another. "I lose track of what I actually need to do for a release."

Slide 14
--------
* The solution? Provide a public link to each Sprint backlog, broken down by 
  team member.

Slide 15
--------
* "Our releases keep slipping."
    * If work was not done by the original deadline, the deadline was just 
      pushed back.

Slide 16
--------
* To solve this, I helped to enforce more strict "timeboxes". If work wasn't 
  completed by the deadline, it was moved out to later.
* This is an important point. The features moved, not the release dates.  
  Because we decided on a high-level goal for each period of work (which you can see 
  here), we had some flexibility to do this.
* Anyway, the result? "We finished with enough time for dedicated QA!"

Slide 17
--------
* "As a user, it's hard for me to know what you're working on."

Slide 18
--------
* I considered this a critical problem, so I responded with a very detailed 
  and well-thought-out process for providing feedback.
* The result? "This new feedback process sounds fabulous."
    * This actually came from one of the people who was most concerned about 
      the difficulty of providing feedback.

Slide 19
--------
* And finally, "We are very bad at estimating, so we never know how much work 
  we should take on at a time."

Slide 20
--------
* I worked with the team to start estimating individual tasks and, using some 
  spreadsheet magic, used this information to estimate the amount of work we 
  could complete in a given amount of time.
* The result? So far, our estimates have been more accurate. You see that 
  there is only a small difference between the average velocity (speed of 
  development) and the velocity of "last week".
* "I like the point system - I think it gives us an idea how much we're doing, 
  where we're spending our effort, and if we're on track." 

Slide 21
--------
* So that was my summer. Finding problems, offering solutions, and getting 
  people excited along the way.
* Thanks again to everyone at Mozilla for making this possible.
* My contact information is provided. Please feel free to get in touch with me 
  if you want to continue this discussion.
* Otherwise, thanks!
