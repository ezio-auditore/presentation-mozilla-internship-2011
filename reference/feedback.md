Air Mozilla Presentation
------------------------

Good

* It was good. You really present well.
* I liked your presentation and I really like your style. Very informal and 
  laid-back.

Bad

* There seemed to be a lot of side stories.
    * Note to self: I tend to ramble. I think this resulted from poor 
      discussion planning on my part.
* You should really shorten the discussion for each slide. You discussed each 
  slide for a bit longer than you needed, and it all piled up to make the 
  presentation run too long.
    * Note to self: Agreed. I needed to tighten my discussion up.
* The subject matter didn't seem very interesting, but maybe that's just me.
    * Note to self: I actually agree here also. I was very excited about the 
      material and still hold that the material itself is interesting, but I 
      don't think I did a good job of conveying that in the presentation.
* When you got to the end, I realized, "Ok, so he did Scrum."
    * Note to self: Interesting point. I should make that clear when I start 
      the discussion on retrospective improvements. "I did Scrum. The next few 
      slides will show you what that means."
